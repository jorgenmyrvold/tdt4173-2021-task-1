    "# Decision Tree\n",

    "\n",
    "For this problem, you will be implementing a Decision Tree classifier that works on discrete (categorical) features. Although a relatively simple learning algorithm, the Decision Tree is often used as a fundamental building block for more powerful (and popular) models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosted ensembles. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should base your solution on the [ID3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithmhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm) algorithm. This is a basic tree-learning algorithm that greedly grows a tree based on _information gain_ (reduction in entropy). Please refer to Chapter 3 of _Machine Learning_ by Tom M. Mitchell for more details. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided some skeleton code for the classifier, along with a couple of utility functions in the [decision_tree.py](./decision_tree.py) module. Please fill out the functions marked with `TODO` and feel free to add extra constructor arguments as you see fit (just make sure the default constructor solves the first dataset).\n"

    "A big advantage of Decision Trees is that they are relatively transparent learners. By this we mean that it is easy for an outside observer to analyse and understand how the model makes its decisions. The problem of being able to reason about how a machine learning model reasons is known as _Explainable AI_ and is often a desirable property of machine learning systems.\n",

    "Every time a Decision Tree is evaluated, the datapoint is compared against a set of nodes starting at the root of the tree and (typically) ending at one of the leaf nodes. An equivalent way to view this reasoning is as an implication rule ($A \\rightarrow B$) where the antecedent ($A$) is a conjunction of of attribute values and the consequent ($B$) is the predicted label. For instance, if a path down the tree first checks if Outlook=Rain, then checks if Wind=Strong, and then predicts Play Tennis=No, this line of reasoning can be represented as:\n",
